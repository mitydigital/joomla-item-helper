# Item Helper plugin for Joomla 3 and 4

This plugin processes Custom Fields for easier access, and provides additional helper functions when working with
Items (such as Articles and Users).

## UPDATE NOVEMBER 2022

Mity Digital no longer create websites using Joomla, and as such, no longer maintaining or updating this plugin. Feel free to fork it to your heart's content. 

Support is no longer available for this plugin.

## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mitydigital/joomla-item-helper/releases/latest/download/plg_content_mityitemhelper.zip),
and install it via Joomla's Extensions administrator interface.

### Updates

When installed, this plugin will be updated through Joomla's Extensions update process.

## How to use

The Item Helper library is automatically included for content through Joomla's `onContentPrepare` event. For most cases,
you won't need to do anything else.

You will need to either add the Item Helper's namespace to your code, or use the full namespaced reference:

```php
use Mity;
ItemHelper::getArticleById(123);
ItemHelper::getFieldValue($item, 'my-field');
```

or

```php
\Mity\ItemHelper::getArticleById(123);
\Mity\ItemHelper::getFieldValue($item, 'my-field');
```

### Get an Article by ID

This is a simple shortcut to load an Article for a given ID. This is purely a helper to make it effortless for you to
load an article.

```php
ItemHelper::getArticleById($artice_id);
```

Accepts:

- `$article_id` of the Joomla Content Article to load

Returns:

- a Joomla Article item

### Get Field Value

Get the Value of a given Custom Field for an Item.

```php
ItemHelper::getFieldValue($item, $field);
```

Accepts:

- The `$item` to process
- The `$field` to find - this is the `Name` of your Field.

Returns:

- the field value, if found

### Get Field Label

Get the Label of a given Custom Field for an Item.

```php
ItemHelper::getFieldLabel($item, $field);
```

Accepts:

- The `$item` to process
- The `$field` to find - this is the `Name` of your Field.

Returns:

- the field's label, if found

### Get Field Options

Get the Options of a given Custom Field for an Item.

```php
ItemHelper::getFieldOptions($item, $field);
```

Accepts:

- The `$item` to process
- The `$field` to find - this is the `Name` of your Field.

Returns:

- the field's options, if applicable

### Get Field Group ID

Get the Group ID of a given Custom Field for an item

```php
ItemHelper::getFieldGroupId($item, $field);
```

Accepts:

- The `$item` to process
- The `$field` to find - this is the `Name` of your Field.

Returns:

- the field's Group ID, if applicable

### Truncate

Truncate a string to a given number of characters.

The output string may be longer than the `$numberOfCharacters` because the function is designed to not break words.

```php
ItemHelper::truncate($string, $numberOfCharacters = 160, $includeEllipsis = true);
```

Accepts:

- The `string` to truncate
- The `$numberOfCharacters` to aim for (see note above)
- Boolean `$includeEllipsis` to include "..." or not

Returns:

- the field's Group ID, if applicable

### Process

This is automatically called when interacting with the item.

```php
ItemHelper::process($item);
```

The `process` method `$item` is passed by reference, and will be modified by the Item Helper. Because of this, you do
not need to store the returned variable, which is the modified `$item`.

`com_content.article` and `com_users.user` will automatically be detected. If you are using a different type alias, you
will need to pass this as the second parameter.

```php
ItemHelper::process($item, 'com_customcomponent.typealias');
```

To save processing, when an `$item` has been processed, the processing is skipped on future requests. If you need to
force a re-process, you can pass `true` as the third parameter. If using automatic type alias detection, pass `false` as
the second parameter, or your custom type alias.

```php
ItemHelper::process($item, false, true);
```

### Re-process

You can call `reprocess` as a shortcut to the `process` call above.

```php
ItemHelper::reprocess($item);
```

This will use the default type aliases of `com_content.article` or `com_users.user`, or you can pass your own custom
type alias just like the `process` function.

### Manually including the Item Helper

If you need to include the Item Helper yourself, you can include the library manually:

```php
require_once(JPATH_PLUGINS.'/content/mityitemhelper/ItemHelper.php');
```

You can then use the Item Helper as you normally would.
